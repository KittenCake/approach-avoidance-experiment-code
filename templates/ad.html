<!-- 
	The ad.html has a very specific format.

	Really there are two "ads" contained within this file.

	The first ad displays to participants who are browsing
	the Amazon Mechanical Turk site but have not yet accepted
	your hit.  

	The second part of the ad display after the person selected
	"Accept HIT" on the Amazon website.  This will reload the
	ad and will display a button which, when clicked, will pop
	open a new browser window pointed at your local psiTurk
	server (assuming it is running and accessible to the Internet).

	See comments throughout for hints

							    <p>
									The BachLab at University of Zurich is looking for online participants 
									for a brief psychology experiment. Healthy people of all ages can take part.
									You have to be able to understand written instructions in English. 
									The task will take you about 90 minutes and will pay 15$ plus bonus. (14$/hr on average)
								</p>
								<p>
									Please be aware that the inattentive filling out of the questionnaires in this task can lead to a rejection of your work and we kindly ask you to go through the questionnaires thoroughly.
							    </p>

							    <div class="alert alert-danger">
									<strong>This task can only be completed once.</strong> 
									If you have already completed this task before the system will not 
									allow you to run it again. If this looks familiar please return the 
									HIT so someone else can participate.
							    </div>
							    <p>
								    Otherwise, please click the "Accept HIT" button on the Amazon site 
								    above to begin the task. Please disable adblockers before continuing
								</p>
							    

							{% else %}

								<!-- 
									OTHERWISE
									If assignmentid is NOT "ASSIGNMENT_ID_NOT_AVAILABLE"
									it means the participant has accepted your hit. 
									You should thus show them instructions to begin the 
									experiment ... usually a button to launch a new browser
									window pointed at your server.

									It is important you do not change the code for the
									openwindow() function below if you want you experiment
									to work.

							    <h1>Thank you for accepting this HIT!</h1>
							    <p>
							    	By clicking the following URL link, you will be taken to the experiment,
							        including complete instructions and an informed consent agreement.
								</p>
 								<p>
							       <strong> Please keep in mind  </strong> that because of this being a Psychology experiment based on learning, you can only start this HIT once. 
 								</p>
 								<p>
							       If you close the experiment window, you won't be able to begin the experiment again.
							       In that case please return the HIT so someone else can perform the experiment.
